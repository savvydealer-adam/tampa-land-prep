Hired Tampa Land Prep to fill and re sod a large depression area in our back yard. They were very responsive on time and did an amazing job! Very hard workers and cleaned up after they were done with the job. Very highly recommend!

I was concerned about erosion of the soil around my foundation. Tampa Land Prep came out and filled in all around the perimeter and tapped it down for a very reasonable price. They were efficient and hard working, but most of all a pleasure to hire.

Austin with Tampa Land Prep came out did some amazing work for us! I had to relocate some full grown bamboo plants and level some ground and he made quick work of it! It went so much easier then I had anticipated and all the plants survived!

Amazing team to work with. Professional, timely and responsive. They perfectly cleared, leveled and prepped a somewhat tricky section of our property so I could lay artificial turf. I highly recommend them.
