Are your “Vehicle Ads” just funding Google’s banner ad network? Dealers are wasting thousands every month on low-intent clicks from Performance Max.


What Happened to VLAs? The "Black Box" Problem
Vehicle Listing Ads (VLAs) are one of the most powerful tools for a dealership. But they’ve changed.

Today, VLAs are run through Google’s “Performance Max” (PMax). This automated engine pushes your inventory across Google’s entire network—including Search, YouTube, Maps, and… millions of low-value banner ad websites (the Google Display Network).


Stop Guessing. Start Capturing.
Let our experts analyze your current VLA or PMax campaign. We’ll show you—in plain English—exactly how much of your budget is being wasted on low-value placements and provide a clear plan to capture more high-intent shoppers.

No obligation. No sales pitch. Just data.

Most Agencies "Set It and Forget It." You Pay the Price.
Here’s the dirty secret: Most agencies love PMax. They plug in your inventory feed, set a budget, and let Google’s “black box” run wild.

The algorithm is programmed to find the cheapest clicks, which are almost always on junk banner ads that don’t sell cars.

The result? Your ad spend disappears, your “click” numbers look good, but your VSRs (Vehicle Sales Reports) don’t budge. You’re paying for “brand awareness” when you need to be capturing leads.





We Don't "Set and Forget." We Actively Manage for Profit.
At SavvyDealer, we believe “Leads aren’t created—they’re captured.”

Your VLA budget should be a capture tool for high-intent shoppers at the bottom of the funnel, not a piggy bank for Google’s banner ad network.

Our managed VLA strategy is different. We fight the “black box” to make your budget work for you.
