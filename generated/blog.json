You can replace this with your own content.\n\n## How to Use the Blog\n\nThe blog system uses Markdown files stored in the `content/blog/` directory. Each post includes:\n\n- **Title**: The main heading\n- **Slug**: URL-friendly version of the title\n- **Excerpt**: Short description shown in listings\n- **Author**: Who wrote the post\n- **Published Date**: When it was published\n- **Category**: Organize posts by topic\n- **Tags**: Additional keywords for filtering\n- **Published Status**: Set to `true` to make it visible\n\n## Markdown Features\n\nYou can use all standard Markdown features:\n\n### Headers\n\nUse `#` for headings (H1 through H6)\n\n### Lists\n\n- Bullet points\n- Work great\n  - Nested lists too\n\n1. Numbered lists\n2. Are also supported\n3. And auto-increment\n\n### Text Formatting\n\n**Bold text** and *italic text* and ***bold italic***.\n\n### Links and Images\n\n[Links work like this](https://example.com)\n\nImages can be included too (upload to `attached_assets/`):\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](/attached_assets/your-image.jpg)\n```\n\n### Code\n\nInline `code` and code blocks:\n\n```javascript\nfunction hello() {\n  console.log(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n```\n\n## What's Next?\n\nReplace this sample post with your own content! Just create new `.md` files in `content/blog/` with the proper frontmatter, and they'll automatically appear on your blog.\n\nHappy blogging!"
