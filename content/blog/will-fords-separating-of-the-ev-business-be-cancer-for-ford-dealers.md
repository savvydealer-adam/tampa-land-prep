Ford Motor has finally stopped denying the rumors and admitted that they are splitting their EV business from the franchised dealer business. The company will be restructuring into three distinct entities: Ford Blue (traditional ICE vehicles), Ford Model e (electric vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial vehicles).

## What This Means for Dealers

The separation creates uncertainty around several critical areas:

### Customer Relationships
When a customer buys an EV directly from Ford Model e, who owns that customer relationship long-term? Will dealers have access to service revenue, trade-in opportunities, or future vehicle sales to that customer?

### Service Revenue
While dealers may retain service capabilities, the direct-to-consumer EV sales model could fundamentally alter the economics. If Ford controls the primary customer relationship, dealers risk becoming mere service providers rather than full-service retail partners.

### Competitive Positioning
Tesla and other EV-native brands have demonstrated that the direct-sales model can work. Ford's move suggests they believe the traditional dealer model is incompatible with EV economics or customer expectations.

### Investment Recovery
Many Ford dealers invested significant capital in EV infrastructure, training, and facility upgrades based on representations that they would be full partners in the EV transition. Those investments may not deliver the anticipated returns.

## The Broader Industry Implications

Ford isn't alone in exploring alternative retail models for EVs. GM, Stellantis, and others are all evaluating their dealer relationships in the context of electrification. The traditional dealer franchise system faces its most significant structural challenge in decades.

## What Dealers Can Do

1. **Diversify Your Manufacturer Mix**: Relying on any single OEM carries increased risk in this transitional period.

2. **Maximize Current Relationships**: While the future evolves, focus on extracting value from existing customer relationships and inventory opportunities.

3. **Build Direct Customer Connections**: Email lists, CRM data, and service relationships are valuable regardless of future manufacturer strategies.

4. **Stay Informed and Vocal**: Dealer associations and political advocacy may influence how these transitions unfold.

## The Cancer Metaphor

Is this change "cancer" for Ford dealers? That depends on how it's managed. If Ford maintains transparent communication, protects dealer investments, and ensures dealers benefit from the EV transition, it could be navigated successfully.

But if dealers are left with diminished customer access, reduced revenue streams, and stranded investments while Ford pursues direct sales margins, the damage could be severe and long-lasting.

The next 12-24 months will be telling. Ford dealers should watch closely, advocate loudly, and prepare for multiple scenarios.

**The fundamental question remains: Can the traditional dealer model adapt to EVs, or will it be bypassed entirely?**
