# Auto Market Recap: Navigating the Shifting Gears of Q3

The auto market is in a period of seasonal adjustment as we head into the final quarter of 2025. Inventory levels are stabilizing, but demand remains cautious as consumers navigate persistent affordability challenges and evolving financing landscapes.

## Key Market Dynamics

**Inventory Normalization**: After years of supply constraints, dealer lots are finally showing healthier inventory levels. New vehicle availability has improved significantly, though premium and electric models continue to face supply challenges.

**Pricing Pressure**: With improved inventory, we're seeing modest price adjustments. Incentives are returning, particularly on mainstream models, though luxury segments remain resilient.

**Electric Vehicle Evolution**: EV adoption continues its steady climb, now representing approximately 9% of new vehicle sales. Infrastructure expansion and model diversity are driving gradual consumer acceptance.

**Financing Headwinds**: Higher interest rates continue to impact affordability. The average monthly payment for new vehicles remains elevated, pushing some buyers toward used inventory or delaying purchases.

## Strategic Recommendations for Dealers

1. **Diversify Your Digital Presence**: With longer consideration cycles, ensuring your inventory is visible across all major platforms is critical.

2. **Transparent Pricing Wins**: Consumers are researching more than ever. Clear, competitive pricing reduces friction and builds trust.

3. **Service Revenue Focus**: As new vehicle margins compress, your fixed operations become even more crucial to profitability.

4. **Adapt to EV Shoppers**: Even if EVs aren't your primary volume, being knowledgeable and equipped for this segment protects market share.

The market is normalizing, but that doesn't mean it's getting easier. Success in this environment requires agility, data-driven decisions, and a commitment to meeting customers where they are—both digitally and in their purchase journey.

Stay informed, stay flexible, and keep your eyes on both immediate opportunities and long-term trends.
