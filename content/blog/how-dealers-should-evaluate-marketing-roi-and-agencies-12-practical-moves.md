# Free Marketing Meeting Checklist Here

**Quick Hits:** Focus your spend on shoppers who are ready **right now**, validate it with simple, human‑readable metrics (time on site, pages viewed, funnel progression), and tie every campaign to **calls and conversations**—not vanity conversions. Meet your agency twice a month: first to set the plan, second to pivot against competitors. Guard your data, mystery‑shop your own site, and pay for **real content**, not monthly metadata tinkering.

* * *

## 1) Aim first at "ready‑to‑buy" shoppers (then brand later)

There are two audiences:

- **Now buyers** (high intent): people searching "new Silverado," "Camry," "F‑150," etc.
- **Sometime buyers** (awareness): people who may buy in months.

Put your **first dollars** where purchase intent is strongest—core model terms on Google. Then layer awareness.

**Quick test:** On a clean browser (or using Google Ads' **Ad Preview** tool), search your top models—e.g., "new Silverado."

- Are you visible in **Search** and **Shopping**?
- Is the Shopping placement yours—or is a third‑party (AutoTrader, Cars.com) outranking you for your **own** inventory?

If you're invisible on your money terms, fix that before anything else.

* * *

## 2) Don't let "store visits" hide bad spend

When agencies optimize only for "get people into the dealership," algorithms often find the **cheapest** path—service traffic. That yields a packed service lane and a quiet showroom.

Make sure your campaigns, goals, and bidding strategies are aligned to **sales** intent (model terms, SRP → VDP engagement, phone calls, forms), not generic "store visits."

* * *

## 3) GA4: keep it simple and watch what matters

Yes, GA4 is complex. Start with two low‑noise signals:

- **Average time on site** (are visitors staying long enough to shop?)
- **Pages per session** (are they exploring inventory?)

Adam's tip: **Send paid traffic to SRPs, not directly to VDPs.**

- It's harder to fake "SRP → VDP" clicks than it is to spoof a single VDP visit.
- That SRP→VDP ratio exposes pricing issues (e.g., if people bounce from SRPs without opening any vehicles).

When you can, export GA4 to BigQuery (or your BI tool) and build a simple **funnel**:

> Users → Stayed 30+ seconds → SRP → VDP → Lead/Call

Where the drop widens, investigate there first (pricing, "call for price," out‑of‑stock trims, in‑transit inventory, page speed, pop‑ups, etc.).

* * *

## 4) Track phone calls the right way (dynamic numbers)

Most modern call‑tracking platforms use **dynamic number insertion (DNI)** so each visitor sees a unique number. That allows you to map the call back to:

- the **source/keyword/ad**, and
- the **pages** they viewed before dialing.

Use it to:

- Separate **sales** vs. **service** impact (you'll learn "dealership near me" skews heavily to service).
- Capture missed calls (and route to a backup line if phones go down).
- Validate platform claims ("Did Facebook actually drive inbound calls last week?").

**Pro tip:** Keep the website simple with **one visible number** and let routing logic do the rest.

* * *

## 5) Mystery‑shop yourself (and your rivals)

Spend five minutes a week doing exactly what customers do:

- Search "new \[top model\]" in your market (use Ad Preview for neutral results).
- Click your ad and your competitor's ad.
- Count the **pop‑ups**. Do widgets interrupt the purchase path?
- Try to submit a lead. How many steps/fields? Any dead ends on mobile?

You'll quickly see friction you stopped noticing—and tricks some third parties use (e.g., their search bars sitting on top of your SRP to drive _their_ leads, not your sales).

* * *

## 6) Guard your data from third‑party widgets

Any widget you embed (badges, chats, trade‑tools) can see a **lot** of your traffic. That has competitive implications: You might be telegraphing your **active shoppers** to vendors who also serve nearby stores. Be selective and configure tools to **minimize data leakage**.

* * *

## 7) SEO you should pay for (and what you shouldn't)

- **Pay for tangible pages** every month—model pages, local content, comparisons, financing FAQs, service explainer pages.
- **Don't** pay monthly for endless metadata tweaks. On a modern site, title/description clean‑up is a **periodic** task, not a retainer.
- Avoid one‑click, AI‑generated articles. Duplicate/low‑quality content tends to **underperform**. Have a human edit for substance and local specificity.
- Spot‑check originality: paste your opening sentences into Google; if 20 sites show the same copy, rewrite.

* * *

## 8) Run a twice‑monthly marketing cadence (strategy, then counter‑moves)

**Meeting 1 (week 1):** Plan

- What we're pushing (e.g., leases on specific trims).
- Budgets, geos, and creative.

**Meeting 2 (week 3):** Pivot

- Review performance and **Auction Insights** (Google Ads) to see who's ramping spend in your backyard.
- If a rival boosts F‑150 aggressively, decide: match, shift budget, or move to a different profit pocket.

Agencies lose accounts not because the initial plan was bad—but because they didn't **pivot** when the market countered.

* * *

## 9) Build a simple "where did this lead come from?" habit

If lead sources are a mystery, assume cannibalization. Example Adam shared: a vendor "proved" value by calling the store's **existing CRM leads** earlier than the BDC, then claiming those sales as theirs. Your process should make double‑counting **impossible**.

* * *

## 10) Validate with the sales floor

If you're spending seriously on a platform (e.g., Facebook), you should **occasionally hear** customers mention it in‑store. If your team never hears it, investigate the landing pages, targeting, and creative.

* * *

## 11) Master Google + Facebook before chasing shiny objects

Geofencing, display, OTT, and YouTube are **amplifiers**, not foundations. Nail intent (Search & Shopping) and high‑quality paid social first. Avoid auto‑generated ads with stock photos—weak signals in competitive markets.

* * *

## 12) Sometimes the month just stinks (don't panic‑spend)

Not every slump is a media problem. If the campaigns are correctly configured and the market is soft, resist the urge to "spend your way out." Optimize price/merchandising and stay disciplined.

* * *

## A 10‑minute weekly checklist

01. **Model search visibility:** Are we present on "\[top model\]" in Search & Shopping?
02. **Auction Insights:** Who's invading our zip codes this week?
03. **Funnel health:** Users → 30s+ → SRP → VDP → Lead/Call. Where's the biggest drop?
04. **Time on site & pages/session:** Trending up, flat, or down by source?
05. **Call tracking review:** Sales vs. service calls; missed calls; keyword/source matchback.
06. **Mystery shop:** Your ad → your SRP → your VDP → your lead form (on mobile).
07. **Widget audit:** Any third‑party interruptions or leaks?
08. **Content cadence:** Which pages went live this month? What's scheduled next?
09. **Sales floor signal:** Did anyone mention seeing our Facebook/YouTube ad?
10. **Budget sanity:** Any channel growing spend without corresponding **engagement** gains?

* * *

## What to ask your agency—every meeting

- _Show me where we rank/appear for our top model searches right now._
- _What changed in Auction Insights since last meeting?_
- _SRP→VDP rate by channel last week?_
- _Calls by source and missed calls?_
- _New content URLs published this month?_
- _What will we **stop** doing next month—and why?_
