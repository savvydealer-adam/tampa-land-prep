# Welcome to Our Blog!

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate how the blog system works. You can replace this with your own content.

## How to Use the Blog

The blog system uses Markdown files stored in the `content/blog/` directory. Each post includes:

- **Title**: The main heading
- **Slug**: URL-friendly version of the title
- **Excerpt**: Short description shown in listings
- **Author**: Who wrote the post
- **Published Date**: When it was published
- **Category**: Organize posts by topic
- **Tags**: Additional keywords for filtering
- **Published Status**: Set to `true` to make it visible

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown features:

### Headers

Use `#` for headings (H1 through H6)

### Lists

- Bullet points
- Work great
  - Nested lists too

1. Numbered lists
2. Are also supported
3. And auto-increment

### Text Formatting

**Bold text** and *italic text* and ***bold italic***.

### Links and Images

[Links work like this](https://example.com)

Images can be included too (upload to `attached_assets/`):

```markdown
![Alt text](/attached_assets/your-image.jpg)
```

### Code

Inline `code` and code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## What's Next?

Replace this sample post with your own content! Just create new `.md` files in `content/blog/` with the proper frontmatter, and they'll automatically appear on your blog.

Happy blogging!
